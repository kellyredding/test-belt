= TestIt

== Description

This is a convenience gem I wrote to package up the most common testing tools and paradigms I use.  It is opinionated and custom to how I like to test.  It is designed to simplify the bringing in and distribution of modern testing practices to my various Ruby tools and libraries.

== Installation

    gem install test-it

TestIt only impacts your testing environment or setup.  Therefore, you should only every use it in one of a couple ways:
 * Development Dependency

    Gem::Specification.new do |s|
      # your spec stuff ...

      s.add_development_dependency("test-it")
    end

 * Gemfile test dependency

    source 'http://rubygems.org'

    # other gem dependencies ...

    group :test do
      gem 'test-it'

      # other testing gems ...
    end

== Usage
=== Test::Unit
just write Test::Unit tests with assertions

=== Shoulda enhancements
I've added some handy extensions to some things shoulda does.  None of these are required so just use them as you see fit.


=== Automatic testing Rake tasks
TestIt can provide an automatic set of rake tasks for testing subsets of your code base.  To use this first add this to your Rakefile:
    TestIt::RakeTasks.new
Now to see what this gives you:

    $ rake -T
